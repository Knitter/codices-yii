- Consider adding price per book and per collection
- Would custom fields be useful? Maybe version 2.
- For ebooks and audiobooks, link(?) to files (may need a user directory, somewhere in user's home?)
- Allow for back cover also? may for 1.5 or 2.0

Details/Objects:
- Publisher [Name, URL, short description]
- Series [Name, number of books in series, number of owned books in series (could be automatic), flag marking the series as finished/completed]
- Language
- ISBN (always 13); maybe allow for ASIN and Google ID
- Link (for any user provided site, eg. goodreads, amazon)
- Added on
- Format (paperback, hard cover, etc.; depends on item type, need a list of common types)
- Publish date
- Publish year, for when no date is available
- No. in series (or just order even if no series was explicitly created)
- Edition
- Volume (for paper only?)
- Plot
- Review text
- Genre
- Info related to translation  (if translated, original title)
- Flag to mark the book as read
- Number of owned copies
- Subtitle (can be useful for non-fiction books)
- Page count, duration (audio, in minutes), size in KB (both ebook and audio)
- Audio specific info (eg. bitrate, narrator)
- Filename for ebooks and audio files
- Location/path, manually set by user, can be anything from a file path to "calibre library"
- Store/Seller name (simple text), eg.: Humble Bundle
- Item type to identify the 3 types of "books" being managed
- Rating (remove own rating, always own)
- Cover (front for now, back cover later)
- Authors (multiple authors per book, don't set a main author, user can just list them by order)

Default UI:
- Table with list of books, filtered by type (allow a "show all" filter); when selected, show right side panel with main details;
- On details, offer link/access to other books by the same author, other books in series, other books in collection, other books by same publisher
- Offer default "Reading List" and "Favorite" collections (remove favorite flag from item details)
- Offer init/setup process where:
    > User can select database location
    > User can select language
    > User can setup initial account, even if only providing username/name/email

Future/Ideas:
- Add ebook reader and audio player? Audio player would be interesting to have and to develop.
